    <h1>Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../images/pumpkin-cheesecake.jpg" alt="A slice of sexy cheesecake." width="600px" height="600px">
    <p>This pumpkin cheesecake is a great alternative to traditional cheesecake â€” especially for pumpkin pie fans! A thick, creamy cheesecake base topped with a layer of spiced pumpkin cheesecake filling sits on a graham cracker crust in this easy layered holiday dessert. Two flavors of cheesecake in every bite! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>

            <li>Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
